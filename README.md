# How to compile kernel for Redmi Note 9 Pro (joyeuse)

## 1. Downloading
Create a working folder, for example `kernel`:
```bash
mkdir kernel
cd kernel
```
Download kernel source:
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Naster17/NetHunter-Kernels/ kernel_joyeuse
```
Download a compatible GCC toolchain. I used AOSP GCC 4.9 for 
[arm64](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/aarch64/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/+/refs/heads/android10-release).
```bash
git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/aarch64/aarch64-linux-android-4.9 aarch64-linux-android
```
Download Clang toolchain. 
I used [Proton Clang](https://github.com/kdrag0n/proton-clang), you can use another suitable one, for example AOSP Clang.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kdrag0n/proton-clang.git proton-clang
```
## 2. Building the kernel
Move to the kernel folder:
```bash
cd kernel_joyeuse
```

All config path: arch/arm64/configs/

Setup default config:
```bash
./build.sh custj_defconfig
```
Setup nethunter config: 
```bash
./build.sh nethunter_defconfig
```
**Note**: `build.sh` - a simple script that sets up environment variables and starts the compilation process.

**Optional**. You can tweak some kernel parameters:
```bash
./build.sh menuconfig
```

Compiling:
```bash
./build.sh
```

Compiling modules (insmod drivers):
```bash
./build_modules.sh
```
After you will see the archive with external drivers. [ InsmodDrivers.zip ]
<br>
Make AnyKernel3.zip:
```bash
./MakeAnyKernel3.sh
```
After you will see the archive. [ NasterKernel.zip ]
<br>
## And now you can flash it via TWRP! üòÅ
